# Llama-AI-Unity-
This is a simple llama AI programmed in Unity. This was inspired from Minecraft's llamas.
1. herdScript.cs controls the herd. It's responsible for spawning the llamas. 
2. llamaScript.cs controls each llama. You might want to play around with the Group() function and implement more specific behaviors [ex: flocking]
